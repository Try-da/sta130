    " Normality of Residuals: Residuals are normally distributed.\n",
    " Homoscedasticity: Variance of residuals is consistent across all levels of independent variables.\n",
    "4. Hypothesized Results and Their Impact:\n",
    "a. Expected Results:\n",
    " Higher fitness frequency and specific types (e.g., aerobic exercises) are significantly associated with greater weight loss.\n",
    "b. Implications:\n",
    " Confirms the positive effect of fitness on weight loss, guiding individuals to develop effective workout plans.\n",
    " Provides scientific evidence to help fitness trainers and healthcare professionals offer personalized weight loss advice.\n"
